# Instructions: 
# tend to steps 1-3 as appropriate, explained in situ.
# the script will produce a single list data object
# containing 3d arrays for 78 variables. (age,ttd,single-year cohorts), sexes separate.
# the object created at the end is called boot.results.list, saving out to ResultsP.Rdata.
# ------------------

# ------------------------
# 1) set parameters
nboot        <- 999    # ? how many should we do? 999?
do.this      <- TRUE    # change this to TRUE
make.figs    <- TRUE     # shall we make the summary historgrams?

# 2) set working directory: you'll need to modify the working dir. Possibly by generalizing the below
# code or else commenting it out altogether and setting manually. Up to you

# for TR computers...otherwise you need to set wd yourself

# ------------------------
if (system("hostname",intern=TRUE) %in% c("triffe-N80Vm","tim-ThinkPad-L440")){
	# if I'm on the laptop
	setwd("/home/tim/git/MorbCon/MorbCon")
	Cores <- 1 # laptop overheats...
	if (system("hostname",intern=TRUE) %in% c("tim-ThinkPad-L440")){
		Cores <- 2 # not used
	}
} 

#Cores <- 32 # (you can also set this manually, override the above)

# 3) last thing to check:
# load in data, either change this path (commenting this one out so I keep it)
# or else make sure Data_long.Rdata is in a folder called Data inside the working directory...
#Dat        <- local(get(load("Data/Data_long.Rdata")))
Dat        <- local(get(load("Data/Data_longP.Rdata")))

# the rest should work fine without further ado. Two figures will also be created 
# in the working directory. These can be examined or thrown out.

# ------------------------
# get packages loaded
# ------------------------
# gives mclapply()-like functionality in Windows. 
# I usually would use parallel package, but that won't cut it on Windows
if (.Platform$OS.type == "windows"){
	# does Hydra have devools? I hope so.
	if (!"parallelsugar" %in% rownames(installed.packages())){
		library(devtools)

# even tho most neg are very close to zero

# TR: I think this list is already solidified, but just in case.
